    <div class="about text">
        <p>
            I grew up in Wayland, Massachusetts (about 20 minutes outside Boston) with my three older siblings and parents.
            I first got into coding<br> in middle school trying to build a video game with my dad—then learned quickly how hard real games are.
            I picked programming<br>back up in high school as a freshman and built a Python tool to monitor and schedule COVID-19 vaccine appointments for family and friends.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since then, I’ve become <strong>fluent in Python</strong> and proficient in <strong>C, C++, Go, Java,</strong> and <strong>Rust</strong>.
            I’m a junior at <strong>Lehigh University</strong> (Bethlehem, PA),<br>studying in an honors dual degree program in
            <strong>Computer Science &amp; Business</strong> with a minor in <strong>Data Science</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm especially interested in back-end development, and embedded programming, and general software development.
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside of class, I’m into music and DJing, rock climbing, reading, lifting, running, basketball, volleyball, building fun projects, and traveling.
        </p>
